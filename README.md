# Evaluation of data visualization effectiveness

The repository contains an evaluation of ArviZ's current functions for visualization and diagnostics. 
For every function, I performed two different analyses: 

 + **Analysis of current defaults:**
 
"Evaluate if ArviZ defaults follow best practices. Write down things we are doing well (if any) and things we need to improve. Any points related to styling, layout, or combination of multiple elements can be considered here."
  
 + **Analysis of usage advice:**
 
"Evaluate current advice included in the ArviZ documentation about using each plotting function. As a first approximation, this should be a list of useful references per plot so users can better understand when and how to use each of them."
   
After the analysis, I did a checkup of the current open issues that are relevant to the visualization in question.
