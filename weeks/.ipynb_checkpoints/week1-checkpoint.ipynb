    "## Week 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The week 1 report contains the most relevant comments and issues found in the following plots:\n",
    "\n",
    " + auto-corr\n",
    " + Bayesian p-values\n",
    " + compare\n",
    " + density\n",
    " + distribution\n",
    " + dot\n",
    " + forest\n",
    "\n",
    "For the evaluation I use `ArviZ: 0.13.0` version downloaded from Github.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relevant comments\n",
    "\n",
    "This section provides the most relevant comments in every plot evaluation, followed by a tracking code using the defined issue when it is need.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. auto-corr\n",
    "\n",
    "The `plot_autocorr()` function from `ArviZ` displays the chain's auto correlation function (ACF).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### defaults:\n",
    "\n",
    " + The x-axis label is blank by default, could be changed to: \"number of lags\" or simply \"lags.\"\n",
    " \n",
    " + The y-axis label is blank by default, could be changed to: \"ACF.\"\n",
    " \n",
    "#### usage: \n",
    "\n",
    " + Update the plot's main description:\n",
    " \n",
    "  \"Bar plot of the autocorrelation function (ACF) for a sequence of data. The ACF is efficiently computed using FFT for every lag for the input array, for more information see [arviz.autocorr()](https://arviz-devs.github.io/arviz/api/generated/arviz.autocorr.html#arviz.autocorr). The ACF plots are useful in particular for posteriors from MCMC samples which may display correlation.\"\n",
    "  \n",
    "### 2. Bayesian p-values plot\n",
    "\n",
    "The `plot_bpc()` function from `ArviZ` displays the Bayesian p-values for observed data and posterior predictive checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### defaults:\n",
    "\n",
    " + The u-plot needs clear documentation, and more details are necessary for the user to establish a valid conclusion. Adding default labels and more profound documentation, such as a better description and more examples, might help the user.\n",
    " \n",
    " + For the p-value plot, explain that the visualization compares the obtained p-value distribution with the theoric expected one.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### usage:\n",
    "\n",
    " +  The documentation must clarify the method used to estimate the confidence bands in u-value plots. [discussed]()\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Compare plots\n",
    "\n",
    "The `plot_compare()` function from `ArviZ` helps visualize a comparison between multiple models using Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOO-CV) which is approximated using Pareto-Smooth-Importance-Sampling (PSIS). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### defaults:\n",
    "\n",
    "  + The plot presents both `in sample` and `default` elpd estimates, making the visualization a bit confusing when it is used for model comparison. [discussed]()\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### usage:\n",
    "  \n",
    " + The standard error is displayed as a horizontal line, which seems more like a confidence interval. [discussed]()\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Density plots\n",
    "\n",
    "The `plot_density` function from `ArviZ` helps visualize the posterior distribution using a kernel density estimation method (KDE).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Distribution plots\n",
    "\n",
    "The `plot_dist` function from `ArviZ` helps visualize distributions using histograms and kernel density estimation method (KDE). \n",
    " \n",
    "#### usage:\n",
    "\n",
    " + How does Arviz select the optimal number of bins in the histogram? [uses numpy's algorithm for c.r.v]\n",
    "  \n",
    " + Changing the number of bins manually is not straight forward, and the x-axis scale labels are mixed, see [fig-dist1](https://github.com/asael697/arviz_docs/blob/main/Reports/dist.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Dot plots\n",
    "\n",
    "The `plot_dot` function from `ArviZ` is an alternative method for visualizing distributions.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### usage:\n",
    "\n",
    " + What do you mean with point intervals? [General term for estimated intervals]().\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. forest and ridge plots\n",
    "\n",
    "The `plot_forest()` function from `ArviZ` helps visualize multiple posteriors. Currently this function displays two different types of plots,\n",
    "\n",
    " + *Forest plots*: display credible intervals.\n",
    " \n",
    " + *Ridge plots*: display marginal posterior densities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### defaults:\n",
    "\n",
    " + The `combined`option defaults to `False`, but these plots' major utility is to summarize the posterior and not as a diagnostic tool. Therefore the visualization seems neater by setting `combined = True`, or displaying different colors for every chain. [issue #2141](https://github.com/arviz-devs/arviz/issues) in discussion.\n",
    " \n",
    " + By default, the forest plot will display the posterior median, but there isn't any argument to change it to the posterior mean. [bayesplot](https://mc-stan.org/bayesplot/reference/MCMC-intervals.html) uses the `point_est` option. [To Do: open refactor issue]()\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "#### usage:\n",
    "\n",
    " + The function's description is vague and not informative:  \n",
    " \n",
    "$\\quad$  *\"Forest plot to compare HDI intervals from a number of distributions. Generates a forest plot of $100(hdi\\_prob)$  HDI intervals from a trace or list of traces.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    " + The description uses the word \"trace\" for model. [issue #2153](https://github.com/arviz-devs/arviz/issues/2153)\n",
    " \n",
    " + The function not only generate forest plots but ridge plots as well, the description should introduce this kind of plots. [issue #2153](https://github.com/arviz-devs/arviz/issues/2153)\n",
    " \n",
    "  + `quartile` option is limited to a boolean option, but `mcmc_intervals()` from [bayesplot](https://mc-stan.org/bayesplot/reference/MCMC-intervals.html) uses two arguments, `prob = 0.5` that controls the inner intervals, and `prob_outer = 0.9` equivalent to ArviZ's `hdi_prob` option. [To Do: open refactor issue](https://github.com/arviz-devs/arviz/issues/2153)\n",
    " \n",
    " + `ridgeplot_quantiles` displays dots for the specified quantiles, but this confuses the visualization as the densities overlap. [discussed](https://github.com/arviz-devs/arviz/issues/2153)\n",
    " \n",
    " + The documentation should specify that the central point is the posterior mean, the thick line represents the quartiles (option set by default), and the thin line is the specified interval. [issue #2153](https://github.com/arviz-devs/arviz/issues/2153)\n",
    " \n",
    "  + `combine_dims` documentation has a typo. The expression *\"See the this section for usage examples.\"* has an extra **\"the.\"** [issue #2153](https://github.com/arviz-devs/arviz/issues/2153)\n",
    " \n",
    " + `coords` argument does not have a clear documentation. Adding the *\"See this section for usage examples.\"* expression cleared things up. [Tissue #2153](https://github.com/arviz-devs/arviz/issues/2153)\n",
    " \n",
    " + Add a description of possible combinations: if you use `combined=False`, `rhat=True`, `ess=True` it is a diagnostics plot. if `combined=False` and `ridge=True` is set, it generates a distribution visualization plot. [issue #2153](https://github.com/arviz-devs/arviz/issues/2153)"
