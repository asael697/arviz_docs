    " \"*A dictionary mapping the model name to the object containing an* `arviz.InferenceData` o *or the result of* `arviz.loo()` *or* `arviz.waic()` *functions. Refer to* `arviz.convert_to_inference_data()` *for details on possible dict items.*\"\n",

    "### 3. Energy plots\n",
    "\n",
    "The `plot_energy` function from `ArviZ` displays gradient-based MCMC energy transition distribution and marginal energy distribution plots.\n",

    "     \n",
    "     - Additionally, the local and the quantile ESS plots are recommended to check that there are enough samples for all the explored regions of parameter space.

The pre-asymptotic convergence rate of importance sampling can be estimated based on the fractional number of finite moments of the importance ratio distribution. GPD is fitted to the largest importance ratios and interprets the estimated shape parameter $\\hat{k}$ as a  diagnostic (most importantly, if $\\hat{k} > 0.7$, then the convergence rate is impractically low).
