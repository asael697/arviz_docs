# Evaluation of data visualization effectiveness
## ArviZ - Google Season of Docs 2021

The repository contains an evaluation of ArviZ's current functions for visualization and diagnostics. 
For every function, I performed two different analyses: 

 + **Analysis of current defaults:**
 
"Evaluate if ArviZ defaults follow best practices. Write down things we are doing well (if any) and things we need to improve. Any points related to styling, layout, or combination of multiple elements can be considered here."
  
 + **Analysis of usage advice:**
 
"Evaluate current advice included in the ArviZ documentation about using each plotting function. As a first approximation, this should be a list of useful references per plot so users can better understand when and how to use each of them."
   
After the analysis, I did a checkup of the current open issues that are relevant to the visualization in question. For more information, see [ArviZ's GSoD proposal](https://github.com/arviz-devs/GSoD/blob/main/2021/viz_evaluation.md).
 
## Week reports

The project execution is performed by weekly reports in which every piece contains a list of the most relevant comments and issues found in every evaluated plot. The current week's reports are as follows:

 + [Week 1](https://github.com/asael697/arviz_docs/blob/main/weeks/week1.ipynb): auto-corr, Bayesian p-values, compare, density, distribution, dot, and forest plots.
